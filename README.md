## Penn State Council of Commonwealth Student Governments GHG Emissions Inventory

In an effort to quantify The Penn State University's Council of Commonwealth Student Governments' total carbon-equivalent emissions throughout its entire existence, I was tasked with the responsibility of performing an inventory of every significant source of greenhouse gas emissions related to the government's activities.

You can find the full report and calculation spreadsheet in this repository.

Let me know if you would like to talk about carbon drawdown in the private sector or at your institution!
