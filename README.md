# CCSG_Inventory
## Penn State Council of Commonwealth Student Governments GHG Emissions Inventory

In an effort to quantify The Penn State University's Council of Commonwealth Student Governments' (CCSG) total carbon-equivalent emissions throughout its entire existence, I was tasked with the responsibility of performing an inventory of every significant source of greenhouse gas emissions related to the student government's activities. This was the first action of this kind by any student organization at Penn State. 

You can find the full report and calculation spreadsheet in this repository.

Let me know if you would like to talk about carbon drawdown in the private sector or at your institution!

## Summary of Results

Throughout its existence and through its various strategic operations, CCSG has emitted approximately **3104 metric tons of CO₂-equivalent** and continues to output about **87 MtCO₂e** annually.
